HOMOTOPY TYPE THEORY 2018 GROUPOID INFINITY 5HT

Foundations volume formalizes the programming language
and its base library, where MLTT is extended with
functional extensionality, HIT, UA, refuting UIP.
The Mathematics volume also contains basics of
Algebraic Topology and Differential Geometry formalized in
cubical flavour of HoTT. Sheaf-theoretical categorical
framework is formalizerd as a study tool.
A set of Addendums at the end contains various language
implementations, and published thematical articles.

The main differences from HoTT is in Mathematics volume.
Formal cohesive primitives are formalized
for geometry and topology. Formal topos-theoretical
constructions are provided with formal categorical
set theory. Foundamental group of circle is proven
to be isomorphism of Z constructively along with
recursors for other HIT types: Interval, n-Sphere,
Helix, R, Truncation, Quotient, Ball, Torus, Shape,
Suspention, Pushout, any CW-complex, up to Homotopy Category,
Homotopy and Cohomotopy theories. Exact Sequences for Groups,
Categories, Pointed Types, and Sheaves are formalized
in Homology and Cohomology theories.
